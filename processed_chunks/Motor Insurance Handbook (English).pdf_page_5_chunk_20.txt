Q.What is the period of the policy? 
Ans. The policy is usually valid for a period of one year 
and has to be renewed before the due date. Pay 
the premium on time. No Insurer offers a grace 
period for paying the premium â€“ the due date is 
the due date. In case of lapse of policy by even 
one day, the vehicle has to be inspected. 
Moreover , if a comprehensive policy is allowed to 
lapse for more than 90 days, the accrued benefit 
of NCB (No Claim Bonus) is also lost.
