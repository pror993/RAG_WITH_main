Ans. Yes, you can avail of the NCB facility if you 
change the insurer on renewal. You would have 
to produce proof of the NCB earned by way of renewal notice from the current insurer . If the 
same cannot be produced, you may produce your 
original expiring policy along with a certification 
that no claim has been lodged by yourself on the 
expiring policy . Hence, evidence can be in form 
of a renewal notice or a letter confirming the 
NCB entitlement from the previous insurer .
